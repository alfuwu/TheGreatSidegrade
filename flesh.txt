this file is for defining ideally what the content suggested in todo.txt should do in game when implemented in more depth. everything is subject to change. this gives a more concrete roadmap to work on and thus makes it easier to fill out the mod.

each shadow orb equivalent: 1 accessory, 1 gun/firearm, 1 magic weapon, 1 melee weapon, and 1 light pet relating to itself (expand upon this further?)
 - fragmented heart drops:
   * accessory: 
   * firearm: shrapnel shooter (short-range, high dmg, piercing, shotgun-like)
   * magic weapon: barrage (fires a storm of piercing shards at the target, magic book)
   * melee weapon: 
   * light pet: fragmented heart
 - gate of oblivion drops:
   * accessory: 
   * firearm: heretic rifle (every 2nd shot shoots an additional oblivion bullet, which is a unique bullet that cannot be crafted)
   * magic weapon: voidrift (opens up a rift to the void, applying a weak pulling effect to hostile npcs and dealing contact damage)
   * melee weapon: shard of the void
   * light pet: oblivion in a lantern (a floating lantern containing a small oblivion flame)
 - pus sac drops:
   * accessory: rotten shoulderguard (+3 def, immunity to rusty ???)
   * firearm: the glooper (fires globs of pus at enemies that poisons them)
   * magic weapon: scythe of rot (doubles as a melee-ish weapon, fires a scythe projectile similar to the death sickle that inflicts the Rusty debuff)

   * guaranteed drop of 7-12 Rotten Skin

   * firearm: abyss ray (idfk atp) (shoots big black lazer, similar to zapinator but w/o the randomness)
   * magic weapon: 
   * melee weapon: living claymore
   * light pet: starving egg

gods (may or may not be scrapped):
 - the player can select one god to worship, which tints their holy-related powers with the aspect of the god
   * for example: uru, the goddess of life, gives a bonus to life regen and a bonus to healing-related holy powers
 - the primary god worhiped in a world is able to move in as an NPC if its total faith is above 5, and will sell holy related items for a special currency that only drops from enemies killed with Holy damage
 - a pope NPC will move in if the total world faith is above 10 and the primary god worshiped is not an evil god
 - a cultist NPC will move in if the total world faith is above 10 and the primary god worshiped is an evil god
 - the pope/cultist sell holy items for coins, instead of the special currency gods use
